                Fetal brain MRI is useful for diagnosing brain abnormalities but is challenged by fetal motion. The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 180,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6% and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed method is also implemented and evaluated on an MR scanner, which demonstrates the feasibility of online image quality assessment and image reacquisition during fetal MR scans.

                Fetal brain MRI suffers from unpredictable and unconstrained fetal motion that not only causes severe image artifacts even with single-shot FSE readouts, but also results in slice-to-slice variations of the imaging plane and long scanning sessions, as the MR technologist “chases” the fetal head in an attempt to acquire artifact-free orthogonal images. In this work, we have implemented a closed-loop pipeline that automatically detects and reacquires HASTE images that were degraded by fetal motion, without any interaction from the MRI technologist. The presented methods demonstrate the basic infrastructure needed for successful prospective automated fetal brain motion correction.

                Fetal MRI plays a critical role in diagnosing brain abnormalities but routinely suffers from artifacts resulting in nondiagnostic images. We aim to automatically identify nondiagnostic images during acquisition so they can be immediately flagged for reacquisition. As a first step, we trained a neural network to classify T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo (HASTE) images as diagnostic or nondiagnostic. With novel data, the average Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve was 0.84 (σ = 0.04). The neural network learned relevant criteria, identifying high contrast boundaries between areas like cerebral spinal fluid and cortical plate as relevant to determining image quality.

                Though widely used in imaging tasks, General
                Adversarial Networks suffer from mode collapse. Various novel
                Generative Adversarial Network architectures have been proposed
                to address the issue. However, there exists little work
                systematically comparing their performance. This work compares
                state of the art Generative Adversarial Network architectures, in
                particular AdaGAN, VEEGAN, Wasserstein GAN, and Unrolled
                GAN, on datasets with different distributions, include synthetic
                and real datasets and with respect to several commonly used
                metrics for quantifying mode collapse. Our findings suggest
                that AdaGAN performs consistently better among the GANs on
                nearly all datasets and Wassertstein GAN performs poorly on the
                datasets. Our results also suggest that one metric is not sufficient
                to quantify mode collapse for GANs as the metrics do not give
                consistent results.

                This work investigates using deep learning to mitigate artifacts in fetal images resulting from accelerated acquisitions. We applied an existing deep learning framework to reconstruct undersampled HASTE images of the fetus. The deep learning architecture is a cascade of two convolutional neural networks combined with data consistency layers. Training and evaluation were performed on coil-combined and reconstructed HASTE images with retrospective undersampling. The datasets derived from imaging of ten pregnant subjects, GA 19-37 weeks, yielding 3994 HASTE slices. This approach mitigates artifacts from incoherent aliasing with residual reconstruction errors in high spatial frequency features in the phase encoding direction.
